# Scrambled Eggs Encryption Mission

## Overview
Scrambled Eggs Encryption is a revolutionary blockchain-inspired security system that employs an adaptive, self-evolving encryption mechanism. Unlike traditional static encryption methods, Scrambled Eggs dynamically responds to security threats by automatically enhancing its protection layers in real-time.

## Core Principles

### 1. Infinite Layer Protection
- **Base Layer**: 1,000+ layers of AES-256 encryption as the foundation
- **Dynamic Scaling**: No upper limit to the number of encryption layers
- **Adaptive Complexity**: Automatically increases complexity when threats are detected

### 2. AI-Powered Security Evolution
- **Clippy AI**: A hybrid Microsoft Clippy and advanced AI system
- **Continuous Improvement**: Constantly develops and tests new encryption algorithms
- **Automatic Updates**: Seamlessly deploys new encryption methods across the network

### 3. Breach Response System
- **Intrusion Detection**: Immediate identification of decryption attempts
- **Auto-Scrambling**: Automatically adds random layers of encryption when breached
- **Zero-Trust Architecture**: Assumes all systems are potentially compromised

## Technical Implementation

### Encryption Stack
```
Layer N+3: [New AI-Generated Algorithm]  <-- Added after breach detection
Layer N+2: [ChaCha20-Poly1305]           <-- Added after breach detection
Layer N+1: [Serpent]                     <-- Added after breach detection
...
Layer 1003: [AES-256-GCM]
Layer 1002: [AES-256-CBC]
...
Layer 1: [AES-256-ECB]
```
