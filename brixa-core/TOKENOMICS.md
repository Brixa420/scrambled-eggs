# Brixa (BXA) Tokenomics

## Overview
Brixa (BXA) is a decentralized cryptocurrency that combines the security of Bitcoin with innovative tokenomics designed for long-term sustainability and community governance.

## Key Parameters

### Supply
- **Total Supply**: 21,000,000 BXA (same as Bitcoin)
- **Block Reward**: Starts at 50 BXA, halves every 840,000 blocks (approximately every 4 years)
- **Block Time**: 2.5 minutes (4x faster than Bitcoin)
- **Difficulty Adjustment**: Every block using the DGW3 algorithm (modified from DigiShield)

### Initial Distribution
1. **Mining Rewards**: 80% (16,800,000 BXA)
   - Distributed to miners over approximately 100 years
   - Block reward schedule:
     - Block 1-840,000: 50 BXA per block
     - Block 840,001-1,680,000: 25 BXA per block
     - And so on...

2. **Development Fund**: 10% (2,100,000 BXA)
   - Locked in a multi-signature wallet
   - Used for ongoing development, audits, and ecosystem growth
   - 25% released at launch, then 12.5% every 6 months

3. **Community & Adoption**: 5% (1,050,000 BXA)
   - Airdrops and bounties: 40%
   - Exchange listings: 30%
   - Partnerships: 30%

4. **Team & Advisors**: 5% (1,050,000 BXA)
   - 1-year cliff, then linear vesting over 4 years
   - Incentivizes long-term commitment

## Economic Model

### Deflationary Mechanism
- Fixed supply cap of 21 million BXA
- Halving events every 840,000 blocks (â‰ˆ4 years)
- Transaction fees will become the primary incentive for miners as block rewards diminish

### Transaction Fees
- Dynamic fee market similar to Bitcoin
- Minimum relay fee: 0.00001 BXA/kB
- Fee estimation algorithm to help users set appropriate fees

### Governance
- On-chain governance using BIP 9-style voting
- Miner signaling for protocol upgrades
- Community proposal system for development funding

## Security
- SHA-256 Proof-of-Work (same as Bitcoin)
- 101-block confirmation for transactions
- Checkpointing for additional security in early days

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Genesis (Q4 2025)
- Launch mainnet
- Basic wallet functionality
- Mining pool integrations
- Exchange listings

### Phase 2: Growth (2026)
- Light client support
- Hardware wallet integration
- Merchant adoption tools

### Phase 3: Maturity (2027+)
- Layer 2 scaling solutions
- Privacy features
- Smart contract capabilities

## Inflation Schedule

| Block Range       | Block Reward | Total Supply | Annual Inflation Rate |
|-------------------|--------------|--------------|----------------------|
| 1 - 840,000      | 50 BXA       | 42,000,000   | 8.00% (first year)   |
| 840,001-1,680,000| 25 BXA       | 63,000,000   | 3.64%                |
| 1,680,001-2,520,000| 12.5 BXA   | 73,500,000   | 1.72%                |
| 2,520,001-3,360,000| 6.25 BXA   | 78,750,000   | 0.82%                |
| ... and so on ... | ...          | ...          | ...                  |
| After 6,720,000  | 0.09765625 BXA | ~21,000,000 | 0.00% (asymptotic)   |

## Conclusion
Brixa's tokenomics are designed to create a sustainable, secure, and decentralized cryptocurrency that maintains the core principles of Bitcoin while introducing improvements in block time and initial distribution. The fixed supply and predictable issuance schedule ensure long-term value preservation, while the development fund supports ongoing innovation and ecosystem growth.
