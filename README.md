scrambled-eggs decrypt file.enc --output file.txt

# Check system security status
brixa status
```

### Python API

```python
from scrambled_eggs import ScrambledEggs, SecurityService, run_tray_app

# Basic encryption/decryption
scrambler = ScrambledEggs("my-secret-password")
ciphertext, metadata = scrambler.encrypt(b"My secret message")
decrypted = scrambler.decrypt(ciphertext, metadata)

# Start the security service as a background process
service = SecurityService("my-secret-password")
service.start()  # Runs in the background

# Start the system tray application
run_tray_app("my-secret-password")  # Requires GUI support
```

### File Encryption

```python
from scrambled_eggs import encrypt_file, decrypt_file

# Encrypt a file with automatic layer adjustment
metadata = encrypt_file("sensitive_document.pdf", "encrypted.segg", "my-password")
print(f"File encrypted with {metadata['layers_used']} layers")

decrypt_file("encrypted.segg", "decrypted.txt", "my-password")
```
