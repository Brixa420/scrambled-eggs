- OpenSSL 3.0 or higher
- Tor (included in package, but system-wide installation recommended)
- 4GB+ RAM (8GB recommended for optimal AI performance)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Brixa420/scrambled-eggs.git
   cd scrambled-eggs
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment** (recommended):
   ```bash
   # Windows
   python -m venv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # Linux/macOS
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   # Start the signaling server (in a separate terminal)
   python -m scrambled_eggs.signaling.server
   
   # Start the application (in another terminal)
   python -m scrambled_eggs
   ```

5. **Build and install** (optional):
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   scrambled-eggs  # Run the application
   ```

## ðŸ’» Usage

### Starting the Application

1. **Start the Signaling Server** (required for P2P connections):
   ```bash
   python -m scrambled_eggs.signaling.server
   ```

2. **Launch the Application**:
   ```bash
   python -m scrambled_eggs
   ```

### Basic Usage

1. **Add a Contact**:
   - Click the "Add Contact" button
   - Enter your contact's ID and public key
   - Click "Add"

2. **Send a Message**:
   - Select a contact from the list
   - Type your message in the input field
   - Press Enter or click "Send"

3. **Make a Call**:
   - Select a contact
   - Click the "Video Call" or "Voice Call" button
   - Wait for the recipient to accept the call

4. **Share Files**:
   - Click the paperclip icon in the chat window
   - Select the file you want to send
   - The file will be encrypted and sent to the recipient

### Command Line Interface (CLI)

```bash
# Start the application
scrambled-eggs

# Start in debug mode
scrambled-eggs --debug

# Specify a custom config file
scrambled-eggs --config /path/to/config.json
```

# Decrypt a file
scrambled-eggs decrypt file.enc --output file.txt

# Check system security status
scrambled-eggs status
```

### Python API

```python
from scrambled_eggs import ScrambledEggs, SecurityService, run_tray_app

# Basic encryption/decryption
scrambler = ScrambledEggs("my-secret-password")
ciphertext, metadata = scrambler.encrypt(b"My secret message")
decrypted = scrambler.decrypt(ciphertext, metadata)

# Start the security service as a background process
service = SecurityService("my-secret-password")
service.start()  # Runs in the background

# Start the system tray application
run_tray_app("my-secret-password")  # Requires GUI support
```

### File Encryption

```python
from scrambled_eggs import encrypt_file, decrypt_file

# Encrypt a file with automatic layer adjustment
metadata = encrypt_file("sensitive_document.pdf", "encrypted.segg", "my-password")
print(f"File encrypted with {metadata['layers_used']} layers")

decrypt_file("encrypted.segg", "decrypted.txt", "my-password")
```
## How It Works

### Core Security Flow
1. **AI-Enhanced Key Generation**: Clippy generates and manages cryptographic keys with AI-optimized parameters
2. **Secure Handshake**: Quantum-resistant key exchange using hybrid cryptography
3. **Adaptive Encryption**: Messages and files are encrypted with evolving algorithms
4. **Tor Integration**: All communications are optionally routed through the Tor network
5. **Continuous Monitoring**: Clippy monitors for threats and anomalies in real-time
6. **Self-Improving Security**: The system evolves its security measures based on threat intelligence
